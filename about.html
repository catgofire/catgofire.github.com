<h1>About</h1>

<h2>Me</h2>
<p>
  I am a student at Carnegie Mellon University, and will be graduating in spring 2010 with a B.S. in Computer Science.
  I like peanut butter and jelly sandwiches with wheat bread, crunchy peanut butter, and strawberry jam. I dislike
  taking pictures of food and filling out forms on paper (life should be more DRY). I have licked crÃªpe paper and
  a 9-volt battery. I don't recommend either.

<h2>This Site</h2>
<p>
  EvilGeni.us was taken, so I improvised. This site is hosted by
  <a href="http://www.github.com" target="_blank">GitHub</a>, using
  <a href="http://pages.github.com" target="_blank">GitHub Pages</a>. You can see its source
  <a href="http://github.com/catgofire/catgofire.github.com/" target="_blank">here</a>. Everything on this site
  was created by me unless otherwise noted. I obviously can't stop you from using any of it, but it would be nice
  of you to contact me first.
</p>

<h2>My Photography</h2>
<p>
  I started out with a Canon A95. I used a Canon PowerShot Pro 1 for a short while, and then got a Canon Rebel XT,
  which is what I currently shoot with. It's a great camera, though I hope to upgrade to a full-frame sensor when
  I can afford it.

<h2>Circumlo.cutio.us [Blog]</h2>
<p>
	Sometimes I have random thoughts. Sometimes I post them. Sometimes I take random photos. Sometimes I write
	them down. If you are ever planning on working with	me professionally, you should not read my blog.
