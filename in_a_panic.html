<br/><br/>This morning he was born<br/>to the sound of her breathing,<br/>her dreams bleeding fantastic<br/>into the eyes of fairy-tale beings.<br/><br/>Nothing stirred but her energy,<br/>whose turbulent emotion had<br/>woken him. The last thing<br/>he remembered was the<br/><br/>drum drip of the heartbeat<br/>rain that had lulled him to sleep.<br/>He wondered if he'd lost it.<br/><br/>INSIDE SHE WAS SHAKING LIKE MAD.<br/><br/>He vomited morning sickness into<br/>his holy hands and the fetus<br/>in blood-blanket lay there starry-eyed.<br/>He slurped it slowly letting the soft<br/>taste run down his throat like<br/>post-nasal drip from Hell. He<br/>reared his thorny head and let his<br/>evil out in sound that shook lightning.<br/><br/>She screamed sleeping and<br/>her soul convulsed.<br/><br/>She woke up in a panic.<br/>
